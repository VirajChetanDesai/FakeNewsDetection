# Fake News Detection Notebook

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook is dedicated to the detection of fake news by employing various machine learning methods. It demonstrates the full workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation, highlighting the effectiveness of different classification techniques in identifying fake news.

## Notebook Details
- **FakeNewsDetection.ipynb**: The single notebook that contains all the code and documentation for the project.

## Dependencies
To run this notebook, the following Python libraries are needed:
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (for visualization)
- pandas (for data manipulation)

These can be installed via pip:

```pip install numpy scikit-learn```


## Usage
To use this notebook:
1. Ensure that all the necessary libraries are installed.
2. Download the notebook and open it in a Jupyter environment like JupyterLab or Google Colab.
3. Run the cells sequentially to see the workflow from data loading and preprocessing to training models and evaluating their performance.

## Data
The notebook assumes you have access to a dataset with text data labeled as 'real' or 'fake'. Ensure your data is formatted correctly and accessible by the notebook.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques to clean and prepare text data for modeling.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Various machine learning models are trained and their performance is compared based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Contributing
